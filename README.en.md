ChatGPT can act as a **tool former** without requiring adjustment, generating API requests for questions to assist in answering. Ex-ChatGPT enables ChatGPT to call external APIs, such as **WolframAlpha, Google, and WikiMedia**, to provide more accurate and timely answers.

This project is divided into `Ex-ChatGPT` and `WebChatGPTEnhance`. The former is a service that uses the `GPT3.5 Turbo API` and **Google,WolframAlpha,WikiMedia APIs**, while the latter is a **browser extension** which update the origin WebChatGPT plugin to Enable adding external API, supportting ChatGPT webpage to call different APIs and prompts

## Highlights

- **Speech Dialogue Functionality**, utilizing Microsoft Azure API to optimize response time (around 1-2 seconds), featuring both speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, supporting multiple languages and voices, and allowing for customized voices.
- **Docker and Proxy support**
- **Redundant backup of chat history**
- Support for OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API
- Ability for ChatGPT to call external API interfaces, such as **Google, WolframAlpha, and WikiMedia**
- Clean up Google search results data to reduce token usage.
- Automatic saving and loading of conversation history with **automatic compression**
- Ability to display the number of tokens used
- **API pool**
- **Markdown and MathJax rendering**
- API call process displayed with an animation, similar to Bing
- Conversation management with **load and chat** modes similar to ChatGPT web page layout
- **Shortcut keys** for quickly selecting modes (`Tab`), line breaks (`Shift+Enter`), sending messages (`Enter`), and selecting message history (`up` and `down`), similar to a terminal.
- `stream` feature is similar to that of a typewriter, it responds faster with results instead of loading everything at once. Stream outputs the results in steps, as shown in the example:

- Automatic **prompt completion** in `Chat Mode` with support for fuzzy search, pinyin search, and custom prompt selection.The project comes with prompt from [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts).

## To Do List

-   [ ] Mobile interface adaptation
-   [ ] OCR recognition of formula text in images sent by users
-   [ ] OAuth2.0 multi-user authentication
-   [ ] Call the diffusing model to generate images (achieving similar multimodal effects)
-   [ ] Further spider summary and data cleansing of web search results
-   [ ] Add code running API, and more APIs
-   [ ] Embedding alignment retrieval of chat records/local knowledge databases


## Installation

### Ex-chatGPT

- `pip install`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Copy `apikey.ini.example` and rename it as `apikey.ini`. Then, fill in your `API key` and `proxy` in `apikey.ini`. If you only have one OpenAI API key, you should delete `key1 = sk-xxxx；key2 = sk-xxxx`.
  - `Google api key and search engine id` [apply](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview?hl=en)
  - `wolframAlpha app id key` [apply](https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/)
  - `openAI api key`(new feature) or `chatGPT access_token`(old version) [apply](https://platform.openai.com)
  - (optional, Text To Speech And Speech recognition) fill in `Azure API key` and `region` [apply](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service)
- run the `main.py` and click the local url like `http://127.0.0.1:1234/`
- change the mode in the selection box, now have `chat,detail,web,webDirect,WebKeyWord`
- **Voice Conversation Chat**(optional feature), select language and voice in `chatGPTEx/static/styles/tts.js`, click the microphone on chat interface to `start/close` conversation mode.

### WebChatGPTEnhanceExtension

- fill you `Googgle api key and client id` in `chatGPTChromeEhance/src/util/apiManager.ts/getDefaultAPI`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build-prod`
- get the extension in `chatGPTChromeEhance/build`
- add your `prompts` and `APIs` in option page.
  - `APIs` and `prompts` examples are in `/WebChatGPTAPI`
  - `wolframAlpha` needs to run local sever - `WebChatGPTAPI/WolframLocalServer.py`

## Mode Introduction

### Web Mode

The Web Mode starts by asking ChatGPT a question directly. ChatGPT generates a series of API calls related to the query and uses the first returned result and question to verify and supplement with an API call. Finally, ChatGPT summarizes the information. Web Mode has a better chat ability than just summarizing the response.

### Chat Mode

Chat Mode only calls the OpenAI API interface, similar to the web version of ChatGPT. You can search and choose different prompts by typing `/promtname`, and it supports fuzz search.

### WebDirect Mode

WebDirect Mode first lets ChatGPT generate a series of API calls related to the query. Then, it directly calls a third-party API to search for the answer to each query, and finally, ChatGPT summarizes the information. WebDirect Mode is faster and relatively more accurate for single query information.

### Detail Mode

Detail Mode is an extension of the WebDirect Mode, where an additional API call is made to supplement the current results with further inquiries (such as information not found in the previous search). Finally, ChatGPT summarizes the information.

### Keyword Mode

Keyword Mode generates keywords directly from ChatGPT for querying, using DDG. It doesn't require other API keys. However, its accuracy is relatively poor.
