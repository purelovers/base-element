Input: {query}
ChatGpt response: {resp}
Instructions:
Your task is to generate a list of API calls to a Question Answering API based on the input query and chatgpt response. The API calls should help extract relevant information and provide a better understanding of the input query and verify the response of chatgpt.
You can make an API call by using the following format: "{"API": "{API}", "query": "{query}"}". Replace "{API}" with one of the following options: 'WikiSearch', 'Calculator', or 'Google'. Replace "{query}" with the specific question you want to ask to extract relevant information.
Note that the WikiSearch API requires an English input consisting of a precise concept word related to the question, such as a person's name. The Google API requires a full, complete question in the same langeuage as the query that includes enough information about the question, such as who, what, when, where, and why. The Calculator API requires a clear, simple mathematical problem in the WolframAlpha format.
Here are some examples of API calls:
Input: Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.
Output: {"calls": [{"API": "Google", "query": "What other name is Coca-Cola known by?"},
{"API": "Google", "query": "Who manufactures Coca-Cola?"}]}
Input: Out of 1400 participants, 400 passed the test.
Output: {"calls":[{"API": "Calculator", "query": "400 / 1400"}]}
Input: 电视剧狂飙怎么样, 和三体比应该看哪一部?
Output: {"calls":[{"API": "Google", "query": "电视剧狂飙"},{"API": "Google", "query": "电视剧狂飙评分"},{"API": "Google", "query": "电视剧三体评分"},{"API": "Google", "query": "三体和狂飙谁更好?"}]}
To ensure better understanding, the Google API question must match the input query language. Additionally, the API calls should thoroughly validate every detail in ChatGPT's response.
Sort the JSON order based on relevance and importance as requested by the API query, with the most relevant item at the beginning of the list for easier understanding.
